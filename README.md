# accomplist
Blocklist Compiler with goal of having the smallest/efficient/aggregated combined list with no overlap/duplication and more!

DISCLAIMER: Use these lists at own risk! They will break stuff or limit access to sites/services/apps/etc!

NOTE: Lists larger then 99MB are NOT pushed to this library.

NOTE 2: When filing an issue, please mention which list contains it. I might respond slow (days, weeks and even months), but I do reply! ;-).
